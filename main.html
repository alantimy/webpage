    <h2>WHAT IS WEB 4.0?</h2>
    <h3>The Evolution of the Internet: From the Beginning to Web 4.0</h3>

    <p>The Internet age has known many definitions. At the beginning, there was what we now call <b>Web 1.0</b>, 
        which was simply named "the web." During this time, the first websites, portals, and online services were developed. 
        Users could only read the information without any direct interactionâ€”it was the web of one-way communication.</p>

    <p>Then came <b>Web 2.0</b>, with the rise of <b>social networks</b> and interactive applications such as blogs, 
        forums, and podcasts. These new tools enabled participative communication. Users started interacting, 
        sharing content, and even generating new content. From being passive consumers, users became active creators, 
        leading to what is also called the <b>collaborative web</b>.</p>

    <h2>Web 3.0</h2>

    <p>Web 3.0 emerged as the next stage of evolution, first mentioned in 2006. It is characterized more by a series of 
        technological advancements than by a single defining innovation. The keyword for Web 3.0 is <b>connection</b>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Semantic Web:</b> A web where information is structured in a way that allows machines to read and interpret content.</li>
        <li><b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> AI-driven technologies capable of interacting with users in an almost human-like manner.</li>
        <li><b>Enhanced Web:</b> A sociological concept where the web is considered the most influential communication medium.</li>
        <li><b>Merger of Poles:</b> The user and the web are no longer separate; they coexist in a continuous cycle of co-creation.</li>
        <li><b>3D Web:</b> The transformation of the web into three-dimensional environments, similar to "Second Life."</li>
        <li><b>Web as a Database:</b> The ability to use the web as a vast database, improving the accessibility of information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All these factors contribute to defining Web 3.0 as an era where the Internet has deeply integrated into our daily lives. 
        We are now <b>constantly connected, anytime and anywhere</b>.</p>

    <h2>And Web 4.0?</h2>

    <p>Recently, discussions about Web 4.0 have emerged, along with predictions for the future. In this new phase, technologies 
        like <b>augmented reality</b> and <b>Big Data</b> will play a crucial role. It is expected that individuals will have a 
        <b>digital alter ego</b> and interact increasingly with intelligent interfaces, such as AI-driven machines.</p>

    <p>Some predict a dystopian future where <b>greater control over information</b> will not only shape the digital world 
        but also influence real-world interactions.</p>
